# Tech Out
## by Alec Armstrong

This is a simple app for demonstration purposes. All it does is says Hello World in different languages.

### This App was made using:
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/)

### To run: (You need to have Node.js and NPM installed)
1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal
2. `git clone https://github.com/itsalbow/tech-out.git`
3. `cd tech-out` to move into the directory.
4. Install dependencies by typing `npm i`
5. When dependencies finish installing type `npm run start`
6. You should get a message saying listening to localhost.
7. Open up your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
8. Click buttons on the navigation bar to see React-Router in action.

(You can also type in the URL. Try http://localhost:3000/spanish)
